Wifi Password Stealer :
To retrieve ssid and wifi passwords stored on another device.
Can be used to penetrate target network without having to capture
4-way handshake and then trying to crack it.


Requirements : Python3.6

How to use :
Start server application on your machine.
Social engineer the victim to download the client file and run using
python3.6
A file containing ssid and WPA2_PSk will be generated in same folder 
as the server application.


Limitations:
As of now it only works if client and server are in same network which
totally defeats the point of penetrating a network .
If anyone knows how to make it such that it can work over different 
networks , please help me improve it accordingly .
